# Eduardo's Dotfiles

Howdy! Welcome to my dotfiles!

I use this space to keep track of my configuration files (Ex. vim and tmux), but I've also find my self
using it to leave some breadcrumbs to future versions of myself about how to setup a new computer.

## Terminal (aestethics)

- Font: [Hack Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
- Color theme: [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-terminal-app)

### Instructions to get the color-theme in the terminal
1. Start Terminal.app and open the Preferences
2. Switch to the Profiles tab located in the topbar
3. Click on the gear icon and select the Import... entry
4. Import the downloaded Nord.terminal file
